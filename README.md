# Pastebin

This is my first back-end project, created using JavaScript and Express.js.
The application looks like a simplified version of the popular website "pastebin.com".

The user can create a post, giving it a suitable title and content. All the posts can also be seen in a list.

Functionalities:
-create new post
-see all the posts
-delete for each post

Technologies:
-Express.js
-Postgresql
-Bootstrap
